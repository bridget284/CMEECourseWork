# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The project is organized into clear weekly directories and contains essential folders like `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox`. This is good practice, allowing for a structured approach to the work. However, a `.gitignore` file is missing, which could help in avoiding unnecessary files being tracked by Git.

### README Files
Both the main and weekly README files provide useful information about the repository and the project structure. Some suggestions to improve these files:
- **Main README:** Adding more detailed installation or usage instructions would be helpful, even if no dependencies are explicitly required.
- **Weekly README:** While it provides a summary of what is included, adding example commands for running the scripts and expected input/output descriptions would benefit users.

## Workflow
The workflow is appropriate for a bootcamp project, with the right separation of scripts, data, and results. Empty results directories, as expected, indicate that the output files are not being tracked, which is a good practice.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **MyExampleScript.sh:**
   - This is a simple example script that runs as expected. It would be helpful to add a bit more detail to the script description and consider removing or improving redundant lines like the second "echo" command.

2. **Boilerplate.sh:**
   - The script does exactly what it says—providing a good example of a basic shell script. However, you could enhance the script by explaining the use of `-e` in `echo -e` more clearly in comments.

3. **TabToCSV.sh:**
   - The script works well for converting tab-delimited files into CSVs. However, the way it appends `.csv` could overwrite the original file without warning if a CSV already exists with the same name. It’s a good practice to check if the output file already exists before writing.

4. **Tiff2PNG.sh:**
   - The script for converting `.tif` files to `.png` is well-constructed. Ensure that `ImageMagick` (convert) is available on the system before running the script by adding a check.

5. **Variables.sh:**
   - The script works but has an error in the command substitution `expr`. It is better to use `$(($a + $b))` for arithmetic in modern shell scripts.

6. **ConcatinateTwoFiles.sh:**
   - This script has a typo in its name. It should be `ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh`. The script works well for concatenating files, but it would be better to check that the input files exist before attempting to merge them.

7. **CountLines.sh:**
   - The script contains a syntax error when calculating the number of lines. The correct syntax should be:
     ```bash
     NumLines=$(wc -l < "$1")
     echo "The file $1 has $NumLines lines"
     ```

8. **CompileLaTeX.sh:**
   - This script compiles LaTeX files but runs into an error if the auxiliary files do not exist. You can fix this by using `rm -f` to remove files without throwing an error if they don’t exist. Also, add error handling in case `pdflatex` fails to compile.

### LaTeX Files
1. **FirstExample.tex:**
   - This LaTeX file is well-structured and includes the essential components of a scientific paper. No major issues were found.

2. **FirstBiblio.bib:**
   - The bibliography is correctly formatted and concise. Ensure that it gets updated as the project grows.

### Other Code Files
1. **UnixPrac1.txt:**
   - The script handles basic operations on `.fasta` files effectively. Consider improving the comments to explain each step in more detail. For example, explain why `tail -n +2` is used when processing the genome files.

2. **CsvToSpace.sh:**
   - This script runs as expected but, similar to `TabToCSV.sh`, it could overwrite files without warning. It’s advisable to implement file existence checks before writing the output.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Across many scripts, adding checks to ensure files exist before reading or writing them would prevent errors.
- **Comments:** While there are comments in the scripts, adding more detailed descriptions in areas with complex logic would enhance the code's readability.
- **Modernization:** In some scripts, like `variables.sh`, updating outdated practices such as using `expr` for arithmetic could improve performance and clarity.

## Overall Feedback
The project is well-organized and demonstrates good coding practices. With a few improvements to the README files, error handling, and modernization of shell scripts, the overall quality could be further enhanced.

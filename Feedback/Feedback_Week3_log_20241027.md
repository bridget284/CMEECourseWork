# Feedback on Project Structure, Workflow, and Code Structure

## General Project Structure and Workflow

- **Directory Organization**: The project structure is clearly organized, with weekly folders (week1, week2, etc.) and subfolders (code, data, results, and sandbox). This structure is effective for organizing coursework and enhances readability.
- **README File**: The README files in the root and `week3` directories provide a good overview of the project, listing key dependencies, installation instructions, and code descriptions. However, the **README would benefit from usage examples or expected inputs/outputs** for complex scripts, particularly those handling data transformations or plotting.
- **`.gitignore` File**: The absence of a `.gitignore` file is noted in the log. Adding one would help manage files that shouldn’t be tracked, such as temporary data or output files.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Add Usage Examples**: Enhance README files by including code usage examples, detailing expected inputs/outputs for scripts like `basic_io.R`, `DataWrang.R`, and `Girko.R`.
2. **.gitignore Addition**: Consider adding a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.RData`, `.DS_Store`) from version control.

## Code Structure and Syntax Feedback

### R Scripts in `week3/code`

1. **break.R**: This script uses a while loop with a break condition and is generally well-structured. Adding comments on loop behavior, especially around conditions like `i == 10`, would improve readability.
2. **sample.R**: The sample functions are well-documented, showcasing differences between preallocated and non-preallocated loops, and vectorization. **Add inline comments explaining key differences** in time complexity for each function.
3. **Vectorize1.R**: Good comparison between loop-based summation and vectorized summation, but minor spelling errors (e.g., “Dimentions” should be “Dimensions”) should be corrected.
4. **R_conditionals.R**: Functions for identifying number properties are well-defined, but **adding edge case handling** (e.g., `NA` inputs) would improve robustness.
5. **apply1.R**: This script applies functions across rows and columns of a matrix, effectively demonstrating matrix manipulation. Adding **function explanations** (e.g., what each function returns) could make the code easier to follow.
6. **basic_io.R**: Manages file reading and writing, but currently has some redundant commands (e.g., writing `MyData` multiple times). Consider simplifying the script or documenting each file operation to clarify its purpose.
7. **boilerplate.R**: A well-structured boilerplate with examples of argument handling. Adding **comments explaining the purpose** of returning concatenated arguments could make it more instructive.
8. **apply2.R**: Demonstrates function application using `apply()`. Adding inline comments to clarify the effect of conditions (like `sum(v)>0`) on function results would enhance readability.
9. **try.R**: Demonstrates error handling, but **`tryCatch()` would provide more control** than `try()` alone. This could make error handling cleaner, especially when used with multiple functions.
10. **control_flow.R**: This script uses various control structures effectively. Adding a summary at the top to describe each control structure tested (e.g., for loop, while loop) would improve clarity.
11. **TreeHeight.R**: Well-structured function with clear arguments and purpose. Adding an example calculation with actual values would help users understand the expected output.
12. **next.R**: Simple and efficient, showcasing conditional loop continuation. Add a comment explaining `next` as a way to skip odd numbers in this context.
13. **browse.R**: Contains `browser()` for debugging within an exponential growth simulation. While effective for learning, **consider removing `browser()` for production code** or moving it to a debugging section in `sandbox`.
14. **preallocate.R**: Demonstrates time differences between preallocated and non-preallocated loops well. Add comments summarizing the performance benefit observed in each case.

### General Suggestions for R Scripts

- **Consistency**: Consistent indentation and spacing make scripts easier to read. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., `break.R`) should be addressed.
- **Comments**: Scripts with complex operations should have additional comments explaining major steps, especially those with matrix operations or nested loops (e.g., `Vectorize1.R`, `sample.R`).
- **Error Handling**: Scripts that rely on external data (e.g., `basic_io.R`) should include basic error handling to ensure file paths are correct and data can be read without issue.

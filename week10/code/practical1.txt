1. +3

2. 480 to 2501

3. The - represents stop codons. The vertibrate mitochondrial code, codes AGA/AGG as Ter (a stop codon) instead of Arg, and AUA as Met instead of Ile

4. tblastn starts with a protein sequence and searches for a dna sequence.

5. Closest match: score = 1380, e-value = 0.0. Fourth closest match: score = 112, e-value = 2e-24.

6. i. the closest match completly matches the input sequence
   i i. identites alignment of 4th closest: 24%, the plus symbol is to show where there are different amino acids but with similar properties (conservative substitution), dashes are for where the other sequence has additional bases.
   For alignment - top and bottom rows are the input and match sequences, the middle row is the similarities.
   
7. 

8. To find out if an alignment is random, query cover is helpful (how long the alignment is), e-value is very helpful, and function of the protein is ver very helpful. In this case, only the last two are random matches, despite the 3rd last having a e-value of 0.25 it is likely to be relevent as the function of the protein is similar to very relevent matches.

Week 2 CMEE coding bootcamp

This week of the course I learned about coding python. I used VSCode as my code editor. The week 2 folder contains this document as a summary and four folders: code, data, results and sandbox. 

The code folder contains the practical work [lc1.py, lc2.py, dictionary.py, tuple.py, cfexercises1.py, align_seqs.py, oaks_debugme.py] and other python files from class work, plus a [__pycache__] folder.

The data file contains files used when running the code (bodymass.csv, Sequence.csv, testcsv.csv, TestOaksData.csv)_. 

The results folder contains the result from the [align_seqs.py]: [best_align.txt] and the results from [oaks_debugme.py]: [JustOaksData.csv], and the sandbox folder has various files used while I was practicing coding. 



#####results directory should be empty, add docstrings to every file and function

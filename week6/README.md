# week 6 coursework - stats in R week 2

## Description 
This repository contains the code, data, and folder structure for Week 6 coursework, organized into separate folders for easy navigation and workflow. This work is from week 2 of Stats in R.

Day 2 was a catch up day and day 5 was used to brainstorm for the assesment so there are not code files for these days.

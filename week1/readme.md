Week 1 CMEE coding bootcamp

This week of the course I learned about coding with Unix, LaTeX and shell scripting. I used VSCode as my code editor. The week 1 folder contains this document as a summary and four folders: code, data, results and sandbox. 

The code folder contains the practical work (UnixPrac1.txt, csvtospace.sh) and class work (boilerplate.sh, ConcatinateTwoFiles.sh, CountLines.sh, MyExampleScript.sh, tabtocsv.sh, tiff2png.sh, variables.sh). 

The data file contains files used when running the code, three fasta files used in Unix.Prac1.txt (407228326.fasta, 407228412.fasta, E.coli.fasta). There are three other data files which were using when running other files (1800.csv, 1800.csv.txt, spawannxs.txt). 

The results folder is empty, and the sandbox folder has various files used while I was practicing coding.

# week 1 coursework - CMEE Coding Bootcamp week 1

## Description
This week marks the beginning of the Coding for Molecular Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) Bootcamp. Throughout the week, I've been introduced to the basics of Unix, LaTeX, and shell scripting. For coding exercises and assignments, I've utilized Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my main code editor.

## Language
Shell scripting - Bash

## Dependencies
NA

## Instillation
NA

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into several key folders to maintain a clean and efficient workflow. Below is the structure and contents of each folder:

- **code**: Contains all the scripts and programs developed during this week.
- **data**: Stores data files that were used in the scripts.
- **results**: Intended to hold outputs from the scripts (currently empty).
- **sandbox**: A place for experimental scripts and practice files.

### Code Folder
The `code` folder includes both practical and class-related scripts:

- **UnixPrac1.txt**: Command sequences used in Unix practicals.
- **csvtospace.sh**: A script to convert CSV files to space-separated values.
- **boilerplate.sh**: Basic script structure.
- **ConcatinateTwoFiles.sh**: Combines two files into one.
- **CountLines.sh**: Counts the number of lines in a file.
- **MyExampleScript.sh**: Example script demonstrating basic bash commands.
- **tabtocsv.sh**: Converts tab-separated files to CSV format.
- **tiff2png.sh**: Converts TIFF files to PNG format.
- **variables.sh**: Demonstrates the use of variables in shell scripts.

### Data Folder
The `data` folder contains datasets and other files used by the scripts:

- **Fasta Files**:
  - 407228326.fasta
  - 407228412.fasta
  - E.coli.fasta
- **Other Data Files**:
  - 1800.csv
  - 1800.csv.txt
  - spawannxs.txt

### Results Folder
Empty folder to store output and results from scripts 

### Sandbox Folder
Folder for experimental code and testing

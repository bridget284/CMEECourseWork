# week 5 coursework - stats in R week 1

## Description 
This repository contains the code, data, and folder structure for Week 5 coursework, organized into separate folders for easy navigation and workflow. This work is from week 1 of Stats in R.
In this week I covered: T-tests, covariance and correlation, simple linear models, simple linear models with multiple explanatory variables, and analysis of variance.

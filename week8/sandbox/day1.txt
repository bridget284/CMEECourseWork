LECTURE 1 - PARALLEL COMPUTING
Objectives - run code in parallel and process data produced, build simulations of populations and communities

HPC: 
Traditionally supercomputers and clusters, nowadays it means using a parallel system can take forms: single computer with many processors, a cluster of many ordinary computers, many computers which access a shared memory
Parallel computing: several processors working at once
Example: counting sheep, split up the picture and each computer can count the sheep in their section then report the answers back and combine. 

Some tasks are great for this eg 3D computer graphics, simulations with different parameters, stochastic simulations - run some on each computer and find average, tasks needing lots of memory can use clusters, tasks which can be automated, there is always trade-off as the process of getting jobs set up on the cluster takes time

Not all tasks this is helpful eg serial tasks eg fluid dynamics simulations as fluid can move between sections.
GPU - graphics processing unit 

How to manage files:
When logged into SSH (secure shell) you can navigate around your remote area, need SCP or SFTP to transfer files between local and remote

How to run jobs:
adapt code to run on cluster (parallise it) as.numeric(Sys.getenv("PBS_ARRAY_INDEX")), save output with i (parameter i) in filename so you get multiple outputs otherwise the last to finish will overwrite the other outputs. Test code locally for time and memory limits.

Random numbers in R
Can set seed to get a repeated order of random numbers using set.seed(1) (pseudorandom numbers) - useful for parallel simulations as you can set different seeds for each parallel task

Data storage:
$Home goes to $TMPDIR (temporary) then I move it back

HOW TO HPC

open ssh (for talking to the computer, running things, using cat etc, use exit to leave):
ssh bs2324@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk

open stfp (moving files between local and remote - using put or get filename.R):
sftp bs2324@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk

to run the sim:
qsub -J 1-32 run_script.sh  (1-32 is the number of clusters)

check on the sim:
qstat

to remove error/output files:
rm run_script.sh.*

to check out error files, can use wc -l run_script.sh.e* to check if the line count is the same in all






example runscript:
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -l walltime=12:00:00
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=1gb

module load anaconda3/personal

echo "R is about to run"

cp $HOME/bs2324_HPC_2024_demographic_cluster.R $TMPDIR # move file from home to temp

cp $HOME/bs2324_HPC_2024_main.R $TMPDIR

cp $HOME/Demographic.R $TMPDIR

R --vanilla < $TMPDIR/bs2324_HPC_2024_demographic_cluster.R # run file in temp

mv $TMPDIR/output_* $HOME/output_files/ # save output files to home

echo "R has finished running"
